## Details

This application talks about 3 different data structures tasks

### 1. Queue

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/queue to see how queue data structure works. It is basically works on FIFO (first in first out) manner.

### 2. Stack

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/stack to see how stack data structure works. It is basically works on LIFO (Last in first out) manner.

### 3. Bubble sort

Worst case complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2)
